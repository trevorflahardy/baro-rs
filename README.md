**baro-rs** is a production-grade, long-term environmental monitoring system written entirely in Rust for the ESP32-S3 platform. Designed to run continuously for months or years, it measures, logs, and visualizes environmental data with exceptional reliability and extensibility.

To date, it would be very hard for you, as a user, to reproduce this project on your own. The hardware is complex, the software is non-trivial, and the design is optimized for long-term operation rather than ease of replication.

Have no fear! With enough time, I hope for this project to evolve out of its breadboard phase and into a completely polished, single-PCB design with 20+ integrated sensors. At that point, it will be much easier for anyone to build (or buy) their own device, use it, and even contribute to the project.

## 🎯 Project Vision

### Current State
A fully functional environmental monitoring device that:
- Continuously samples temperature and humidity (SHT40 sensor)
- Stores data persistently on microSD with intelligent rollups
- Displays real-time readings and historical trends on a color LCD
- Synchronizes time via SNTP over Wi-Fi
- Handles errors gracefully (missing SD card, sensor failures, network issues)
- Runs efficiently on battery or USB power

### Long-Term Goal
**A comprehensive, single-PCB environmental monitoring platform with 20+ sensors**, providing:
- Complete environmental profiling (temperature, humidity, pressure, light, air quality, CO₂, VOC, etc.)
- Multi-year data retention with smart aggregation
- Beautiful, customizable UI with multiple visualization modes
- Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and OTA updates
- Open, documented APIs for integration with other systems

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity First** — Each subsystem is isolated with clear boundaries
2. **Type-Safe Hardware** — Compile-time guarantees for sensor indexing and bus access
3. **Error Handling** — Centralized `AppError` type, no panics in production code
4. **Async-First** — Embassy executor for efficient multitasking
5. **Zero Magic** — Explicit, readable code over clever abstractions
6. **Production-Grade** — Designed for years of unattended operation

### Storage Architecture

The storage system is optimized for **long-term operation** on SD cards:

- **Raw samples** (10s interval): 24-hour ring buffer
- **5-minute rollups**: 30-day retention (avg/min/max)
- **1-hour rollups**: 1-year retention
- **Daily rollups**: Multi-year retention
- **All-time statistics**: Lifetime min/max/avg

All data structures use **fixed-size records** with **version headers** for forward compatibility. See [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md) for detailed design.
